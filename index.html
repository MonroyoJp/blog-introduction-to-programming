        Computers have been a part of our lives to the point that it is impossible to imagine our world today
        without them. Back then, their creation was intended solely to serve as a computational device, but
        through innovation and advancement, it has since evolved and become widespread.
        With its capabilities, many consumers adopted it, reshaping their work procedures and
        performance. The computer industry has not only enhanced our work productivity with its speed
        and performance, but it has also impacted certain aspects of our daily lives.
        It changes the way we learn, live, and connect with people from various countries.
        As a result, computers have been adopted in various fields, such as business operations,
        healthcare, education, entertainment, transportation, and even manufacturing. With countless
        industries inclining towards technology, it is safe to say that computers have now become at the
        heart of various industries.

            <h2>First Generation of Computers (1940s)</h2>
            <p>The first generation of computers was developed in the 1940s. It consists of a massive block of
            machines powered by vacuum tubes, built only for simple calculations and data processing.</p>

  <h2 class="big">The Rapid Growth of Computers in Industry</h2>
  <br>

  <div class="accordion">
    <h2>1. Computers in Business and Finance</h2>
    <p>Businesses now rely heavily on computers to stay competitive. With the computer industry, a lot of
      manual transactions have shifted. From employee to client interaction to digital transactions, from
      on-site banking to online banking, and from manual ledger to automated accounting systems.
      Additionally, Stock trading that was once conducted through face-to-face human interaction is now
      handled by algorithms running on powerful servers. Even small businesses use cloud-based
      systems for sales, marketing, and customer engagement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion">
    <h2>2. Computers in Healthcare</h2>
    <p>The healthcare industry has seen life-changing innovations thanks to computers.
      Before Electronic Health Records (EHRs), healthcare staff had to manually write everything —
      our name, medications, and medical progress. This manual process often caused
      misunderstandings and handwriting errors, which sometimes resulted in medication mistakes.
      As a solution, EHRs were created, making patient data more accessible and accurate.
      AI-powered tools now assist doctors in diagnosing diseases with remarkable accuracy.
      Later on, robotic-assisted surgeries, wearable fitness devices, and telemedicine breakthroughs
      have made healthcare faster, safer, and more efficient.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion">
    <h2>3. Computers in Education</h2>
    <p>Computers have opened education to a global audience. Platforms like Khan Academy,
      Udacity, Coursera, and Edmodo allow students to learn from anywhere in the world.
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, computers and the internet became the lifeline of education,
      enabling remote learning for millions. Virtual reality (VR) classrooms and interactive e-books
      are reshaping how knowledge is delivered. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
      as a tool in education, learning methods will only continue to improve, aiming for
      greater engagement and efficiency.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion">
    <h2>4. Computers in Entertainment and Media</h2>
    <p>The computer industry has completely transformed entertainment and media.
      Streaming platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube rely on massive data centers and
      recommendation algorithms. Video games, once limited to arcades, now feature advanced
      graphics and online multiplayer modes. Even traditional media such as journalism and film
      production rely on digital editing software and publishing platforms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion">
    <h2>5. Global Statistics on Computer Growth</h2>
    <img src="img/internet_users.png" alt="">
    <p>According to Statista, over 5.3 billion people now use the internet.</p>
    <img src="img/it_spending.png" alt="">
    <p> Global IT spending
      surpassed $5 trillion (approximately ₱284.85 trillion) in 2024, showing just how vital
      computers are in almost every sector of the economy. With these statistics, the computer
      industry’s rapid growth shows no sign of slowing down.</p>

        <section class="blog-section">
        <h2 class="big">Why IT Careers Matter Today</h2><br>
        <p>Choosing a career in IT is not just about financial stability — it’s about contributing to
        global innovation. Every company, even small ones, needs IT experts to remain competitive.
        Without them, businesses risk being left behind by technological trends.
        According to AWS & Gallup (2023), workers with advanced digital skills earn
        65% more than non-digital workers, adding nearly US$1 trillion to Asia-Pacific GDP.
        Most importantly, IT careers give individuals the power to shape the future,
        from AI that diagnoses diseases to apps that connect communities.</p>
